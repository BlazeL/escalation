My Bsc thesis for ELTE

A small HTML5 game inspired by Galcon (galcon.com)

Fast paced multilpayer real time strategy. Multiplatform (touch/mouse input).


It is in a pretty pathetic form right now, i abandoned it half a year ago, so i'm trying to salvage as much as possible from my previous work on it. Pushing only after something presentable is ready.
